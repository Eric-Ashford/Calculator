### Accomplishments
> Assigning values to button events to be used in calculations by concatenating their values into a string, then converting that string into a Double data type.

> Creating functions by using events that are called when a button is pressed to handle clearing data, calculating results, or assigning an operation.

> Created a layout for all 7 dpi options for a phone.


### What can be improved
> Making operations(+,-,/,*) appear on the screen

> Adding a backspace function delete last entered button press

> More calculator functions (Square roots, exponentials, etc.)

### Known Bugs
> If numbers are input to fast, the program may crash.

> Phones with the same DPI but seperate widths will have buttons not lined up in their layouts. (Tested on a Note 8 and a Nexus 5X)
